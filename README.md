# Composite Wall Mod
A mod for Mindustry that adds new composite walls.

# Usage
Download the .jar and import it into Mindustry. After a client restart, the blocks should be ready. 

## Multiplayer
This mod is not designed to work in multiplayer. Don't expect it to continuously work on a dedicated/headless server.

Although, with that said, it has worked fine from my testing.

## Singleplayer
Join any save you wish. Currently, this mod doesn't exclude itself from the Erekir tree verbatimly, so do expect to see
composite walls on an Erekir planet/sector.

This mod also doesn't include any tech tree requirements, so you'll likely have it unlocked immediately in campaign. 
The only issue is that you'll need the required materials to use it.

# Balancing
Balancing wasn't a huge factor within the development of this mod. As of now, certain walls just takes the average of
other walls. For example, the surge-plastanium composite wall takes the surge alloy wall's health and 
the plastanium wall's health before averaging them together. 

# Contribution
Any contribution is appreciated. This mod was primarily a hobby project that I did in order to try out Mindustry modding.
With that said, don't expect frequent updates.
